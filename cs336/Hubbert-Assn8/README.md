We will now move the site into Flask. In this assignment, we will shift the siteâ€™s HTML
pages into Flask and convert them to templates. Additionally, we will slightly reorganize
the site so that images, javascript, and css reside in the static directory.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pipenv.
```bash
pip install pipenv
```
Once installed you need to connect pipenv to your PyCharm by adding a new
python interpreter.

Use the following instructions to do so [install pipenv into Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pipenv.html)

## Usage
1. Create run configuration for app.py.
2. Create a .env file in the root.
3. Copy a one of the environment variable sets from .env.template into .env (development | production)
4. Run script app.py using run configuration.
