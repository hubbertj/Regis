# Hubbert-Assn7

Every conference attendee must have a nametag. Creating the nametags is an
administrative task, so we will need to add a page for administration tasks to the site. For
your conference, at this stage of development, the data for the nametags will be read
from a .csv text file. The data file is provided in the online assignment page.
Using this data, a Python program should create pages of html that display the
nametags. These nametag pages will be stored in the website. The administrative page
will have links to those pages.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pipenv.
```bash
pip install pipenv
```
Once installed you need to connect pipenv to your PyCharm by adding a new
python interpreter.

Use the following instructions to do so [install pipenv into Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pipenv.html)
