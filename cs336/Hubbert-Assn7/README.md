# Hubbert-Assn7

Every conference attendee must have a nametag. Creating the nametags is an
administrative task, so we will need to add a page for administration tasks to the site. For
your conference, at this stage of development, the data for the nametags will be read
from a .csv text file. The data file is provided in the online assignment page.
Using this data, a Python program should create pages of html that display the
nametags. These nametag pages will be stored in the website. The administrative page
will have links to those pages.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
