Week 1 Regis:

The Participation assignment in this Topic listed a number of simplifications made in the design of the Vacuum World Simulator example found in the Reinforcement Activities associated with this Topic. In this Assignment, you must extend the design and implementation of this Vacuum World Simulator to remove one of the following simplifications by:

Extending the design and implementation so that it handles multiple locations, such as vacuuming the rooms in a house
Extending the design and implementation so that the rules are not hard-coded in the agent program.
Extending the design and implementation so there is another agent that makes messes (Dirt?) that must be cleaned up.
In each case, you must also design the performance measures that should be used to assess whether the agent is behaving rationally.
