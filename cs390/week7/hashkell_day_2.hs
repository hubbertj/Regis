Write a sort that takes a list and a function that compares its two arguments and then returns a sorted list.
Test the new sort function with various comparisons, different lists, and lengths of lists.
Write a function that takes an argument x and returns a lazy sequence that has every third number, starting with x.  Then, write a function that includes every fifth number, beginning with y.  Combine these functions through composition to return every eighth number, beginning with x+y.
Test this function using a variety of x and y values.
